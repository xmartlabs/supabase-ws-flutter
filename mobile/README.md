## Purpose
Xmartchat acts as a hands-on, interactive showcase during our workshop, highlighting the power and flexibility of serverless computing.
Through this demo app, participants will:
- *Learn Serverless Principles:* Understand the fundamental concepts behind serverless architecture and its advantages in modern app development.
- *Explore Supabase Features:* Discover how Supabase simplifies database management, authentication, and real-time data synchronization.
- *Experience Real-Time Communication:* Interact with Xmartchat's real-time messaging capabilities to witness serverless technology in action.
- *Inspire Innovation:* Use Xmartchat as a foundation for experimenting with serverless concepts, encouraging innovative thinking and development.

## Workshop requirements

To effectively engage with the Xmartchat demo app and our Supabase workshop, please ensure you have the following:
- *Flutter Installation:* Make sure you have Flutter installed on your system. If not, you can follow the official Flutter installation guide: [Flutter Installation Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- *Dart & Flutter Knowledge:* Familiarity with Dart programming language and Flutter framework is essential. If you are new to Dart and Flutter, consider going through the official documentation and tutorials to strengthen your skills.
- *Integrated Development Environment (IDE):* You'll need an IDE for Flutter development. We recommend using either Visual Studio Code (VS Code) or Android Studio. Choose the one you are most comfortable with and ensure it's properly set up for Flutter development.

## Solution Structure

In the 'Mobile' folder, you'll find all the code for the application developed in Flutter, while in the 'Backend' folder, you'll discover the edge functions using Supabase. Additionally, you can locate the 'SolutionCode' file, which provides a step-by-step guide for the workshop.
